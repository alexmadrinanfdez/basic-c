# basic-c

Basic examples of the `C` programming language usage. Modified from [this C tutorial](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c-tutorial.html).

## Structure

- `intro`
    + `hello.c`: a must in every programming language.
    + `input.c`: accepts as input an integer given by the user.
    + `flow-ctrl.c`: flow control structures (`if else` and loops) and statements (`continue` and `break`).
    + `switch-case.c`: compare a variable to several _integral_ (integer) values.
- `builtin`
    + `ptr.c`: simple pointer operations and intuition. Includes `malloc()`.
